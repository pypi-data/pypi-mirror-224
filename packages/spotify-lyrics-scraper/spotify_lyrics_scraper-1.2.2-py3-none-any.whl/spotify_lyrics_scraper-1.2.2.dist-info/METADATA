To obtain the sp_dc or sp_key:
- Open a ***new Incognito Window*** in your browser. Head to https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login?continue=https:%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F
- Open Developer Tools (CTRL+SHIFT+I or F12) and head to the "Network" tab and make sure it is recording.
- Login to Spotify.
- Search/Filter for `fraud` or `?flow_ctx` or `masthead` in the "Network" tab. (some of these may be patched, try others)
- Under cookies for the request, you will see "sp_dc" and "sp_key".
- Close the window ***WITHOUT LOGGING OUT*** (else said cookies will be made invalid).

print(spotify.getLyrics(token, songName="Song"))

lyrics = spotify.getLyrics(token, songName="Song")
if type(lyrics) == spotify.spotifyDict: print(lyrics.formatLyrics()) # there are several modes, 0/none is just lyrics, 1 is starting time in ms, 2 is starting time in seconds
else: print(f"Error: {lyrics}")
```

##### Example 4 (sp_key)

token = spotify.getToken("SP_DC Here", "SP_Key Here") #SP Key can give you up to a year worth of spotify tokens.
print(spotify.getLyrics(token, songName="Song"))

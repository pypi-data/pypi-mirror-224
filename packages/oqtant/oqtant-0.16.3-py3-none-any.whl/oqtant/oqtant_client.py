    """Python class for interacting with Oraqle
    This class contains tools for:
        - Accessing all of the functionality of the Oraqle Web App (https://oraqle-dev.infleqtion.com)
            - BARRIER (Barrier Manipulator) jobs
            - BEC (Ultracold Matter) jobs
        - Building parameterized (i.e. optimization) experiments using OqtantJobs
        - Submitting and retrieving OqtantJob results
    How Oqtant works:
        1.) Construct a single or list of OqtantJobs using 'generate_oqtant_job()'
        2.) Run the single or list of OqtantJobs on the Oraqle hardware using 'run_jobs()'
            - There is a limit of 30 OqtantJobs per use of 'run_jobs()'
        3.) As OqtantJobs are running, the results are automatically stored in 'active_jobs'
            - The OqtantJobs stored in 'active_jobs' are available until the python session ends
        4.) If you choose to not track the status of OqtantJobs with 'run_jobs()' you can see the status
            of your session's active OqtantJobs with 'see_active_jobs()'
        5.) To operate on jobs submitted in a previous session you can load them into your 'active_jobs'
            by using either 'load_job_from_id()' or 'load_job_from_file()'
        6.) To analyze OqtantJob objects and use Oqtant's job analysis library reference the OqtantJob
            class documentation located in 'oqtant/job.py'

## Purpose
The tool aims to help developers synchronize their environmental variable keys. This is achieved by 
comparing each local `.env{specificity extension (e.g. .docker)}` file with the corresponding `.env{specificity extension}.example` file
and ensure all keys are matched. Therefore when pushed to remote and pulled by other developers, they can update their env variables
according to the updated .example templates.

## Use
To work the **minions**, your root directory must be a git repo.
Run the command `gru` in terminal and they shall add the necessary git hooks to .git/hooks.
```
Successfully made hook file an executable
Hook file '/path-to-your-directory/.git/hooks/pre-push' successfully populated.
```
You are good to go!

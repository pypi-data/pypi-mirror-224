OpenSesame Plug-in: Experiment Manager
==========

*An OpenSesame plug-in for managing/executing multiple OpenSesame experiments.*  

Copyright, 2022, Bob Rosbag  


## 1. About
--------

This plug-in can insert standalone OpenSesame Experiments within a main experiment. 
It can run within a loop or sequence as an item. This makes it possible to run a number 
of experiments in sequence (random or fixed order) and also it gives the possibility to 
give each experiment its own (different) backend. 

This plug-in has three options:

- *Dummy mode* for testing experiments.
- *Verbose mode* for testing experiments.
- *Experiment file name* for Windows: hexadecimal or decimal value, for Linux: full path or port number.

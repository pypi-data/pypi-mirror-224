# `Rpy_symmetry`
Light weight bridge from `R` to `python` of the [`symmetry` R-module](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/symmetry).


By default, the Symmetry test uses the one from:

    Mira A (1999) Distribution-free test for symmetry based on Bonferroni's measure. J Appl Stat 26(8):959–972. https://doi.org/10.1080/02664769921963

## Requirements
`R` needs to be installed (`conda install -c conda-forge r-base`). The python interface is built on [`rpy2`](https://rpy2.github.io/).

## Examples
See example notebook

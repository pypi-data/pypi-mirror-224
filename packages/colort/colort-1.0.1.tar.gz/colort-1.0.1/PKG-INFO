This module provides functions for formatting text with ANSI escape codes to add color and style.

## Installation

```shell
pip install colort
```

## Usage

```python
from colort import colorize
```

The `colorize` function takes a string and any number of `Style` and `*Color` enums. It returns the string formatted with the specified styles.

For example:

```python
from colorformat import colorize, ForegroundColor as fc, Style

colored_text = colorize('Hello World!', fc.GREEN, Style.BOLD)
print("colored text: ", colored_text)
```

This will print the text in bold and green.

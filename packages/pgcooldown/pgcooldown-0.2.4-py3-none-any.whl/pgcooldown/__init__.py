    This can be used to time sprite animation frame changes, weapon cooldown in
    shmups, all sorts of events when programming a game.

    If you want to use the cooldown more as a timing gauge, e.g. to modify
    acceleration of a sprite over time, have a look at the `LerpThing` class
    below, which makes this incredibly easy.

    Once instantiated, it saves the current time as t0.  On every check, it
    compares the then current time with t0 and returns as 'cold' if the
    cooldown time has passed.

    The cooldown can be paused, in which case it saves the time left.  On
    restart, it'll set again t0 to the remaining time and continues to compare
    as normal against the left cooldown time.

    At any time, the cooldown can be reset to its initial or a new value.

    A cooldown can be compared to int/float/bool, in which case the `remaining`
    property is used.

    Cooldown provides a "copy constructor", meaning you can initialize a new
    cooldown with an existing one.  In contrast to the compare operations,
    which work on the time remaining, this uses the `duration` attribute.

    Note, that only the duration is used.  The pause state is *not*.

    In case you want to initialize one `Cooldown` with another, the `duration`
    attribute is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration: float | pgcooldown.Cooldown
        Time to cooldown in seconds

    cold: bool = False
        Start the cooldown already cold, e.g. for initial events.

    Attributes
    ----------
    remaining: float
        remaining "temperature" to cool down from

    duration: float
        When calling `reset`, the cooldown is set to this value.
        Can be modified directly or by calling `cooldown.reset(duration)`

    normalized: float
        Give the remaining time as fraction between 0 and 1.

    paused: bool
        to check if the cooldown is paused.

    cold: bool
        Has the time of the cooldown run out?

    hot: bool
        Is there stil time remaining before cooldown?  This is just for
        convenience to not write `cooldown not cold` all over the place.

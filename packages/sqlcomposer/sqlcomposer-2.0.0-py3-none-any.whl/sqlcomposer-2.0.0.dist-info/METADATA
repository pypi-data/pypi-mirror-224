# SQL Composer

SQL Composer is SQL query builder for people who love raw SQL and just need a
little "something" to make it composable. SQL Composer is this little
"something".

With SQL builder you write raw SQL queries in ordinary .sql files and add
composable bits which you enable with help of SQL composer.

Any variables which you need to substitute should be passed to SQL Composer
when enabling a part of your query. This way SQL can _do-the-right-thing_ and
substitute them with database-specific named placeholders, which will be
properly escaped by the underlying database. When using this technique, you
don't have to worry about SQL Injection attacks.

Below are some scenarios where SQL builder is especially useful.

_NOTE_: we're using sqlite dialect of SQL in below examples.

## Preparing Query Builder

First we need to create some SQL scripts. They can be ordinary raw SQL files,
but this would be no fun, as they could be simply read and sent to the
engine.

Instead we'll annotate our scripts with _subqueries_. Subqueries are
replacements, typically written at the top of the script, which SQL Composer
uses to replace parts of the query.

Subqueries are SQL comments, starting with two dashes `--`, followed by the
`sub` string, followed by the subquery name, followed by the colon `:`,
followed by the actual SQL string. For example:

```sql
-- insert_feeds.sql

-- sub values: {binds}
-- sub and_return: RETURNING id, name, rss
INSERT INTO feeds(name, rss)
VALUES {values}
{and_return}
```

Above script has two subqueries which might be replaced: `values` and
`and_return`. Let's also create a second query which we'll need later:

```sql
-- get_feeds.sql

-- sub where_rss_is: AND rss = :url
-- sub where_name_is: AND name = :name
-- sub where_name_is_in: AND name IN ({names})
-- sub order_by: ORDER BY {what}
SELECT id, name, rss
FROM feeds
WHERE
  true
  {where_rss_is}
  {where_name_is}
  {where_name_is_in}
{order_by}
```


Now we need to initialize instance of `QueryLoader` and tell it
where to search for the scripts.

Depending on how you'd like to distribute your application, `QueryLoader`
might load scripts either from a package or ordinary directory.

### Loading from the Package

Let's say that you'd like to distribute SQL scripts together with your
application in a single Python package. In that case, you should create a
sub-package inside your application's package. You do this by creating a
subdirectory in the source tree of your application and by putting
`__init__.py` file inside there. You might end up with a directory structure
like this:

```
.
+- src/
   +- myapp/
     +- __init__.py
     +- app.py
     +- queries/
        +- __init__.py
        +- insert_feeds.sql
        +- get_feeds.sql
+- pyproject.toml
```

In this case you should initialize QueryLoader like this:

```python
from sqlcomposer import QueryLoader

loader = QueryLoader(package="myapp.queries")
```

### Loading from the Path

Alternatively you can pass a path to the directory which contains your SQL
scripts. Both absolute and relative paths are accepted.

```python
from sqlcomposer import QueryLoader

loader = QueryLoader(path="/home/user/myapp/src/myapp/queries")
```

## Preparing the query

To load a query, simply call a method on QueryLoader's instance with the name
of the file:

```python
get_feeds = loader.get_feeds()
```

Now we can easily compose parts of this query. For example if we'd like to
filter only feeds with specific names and make sure they're ordered by name:

```python
get_feeds = loader.get_feeds()
get_feeds.where_name_is(name="foo").order_by(what="name")

cursor.execute(get_feeds.sql(), get_feeds.params)
```

`get_feeds.sql()` produces the following query:

```sql
SELECT id, name, rss
FROM feeds
WHERE
  true
  AND name = :name
ORDER BY name
```

Alternatively we may decide to fetch feeds with names from a set of values:

```python
from sqlcomposer import QueryLoader, Another

get_feeds = loader.get_feeds()
get_feeds.where_name_is_in(names=Another("foo", "bar", "baz")).order_by(what="name")
cursor.execute(get_feeds.sql(), get_feeds.params)

# or alternatively:

get_feeds = loader.get_feeds()
for name in ["foo", "bar", "baz"]:
    get_feeds.where_name_is_in(names=Another("foo"))
get_feeds.order_by(what="name")

cursor.execute(get_feeds.sql(), get_feeds.params)
```

Here we wrap the set of values in `Another()` object. This is a way of
telling SQL Composer that we want to create a separate placeholder for each
value inside it and put them in place of `{names}` substitution in
`where_name_is_in` subquery. We can repeat adding more values wrapped in
`Another()` object and they will be added to the values added previously, as
presented in the alternative form  of this query.

If we called `where_name_is(names="foo")` (i.e. with a value not wrapped
inside `Another()` object), it'd overwrite the previous setup.

Above code produces the following query:

```sql
SELECT id, name, rss
FROM feeds
WHERE
  true
  AND name IN (:names_p1_0, :names_p1_1, :names_p1_2)
ORDER BY name
```

If you inspect the `get_feeds.params`, you'll see that it is a dictionary
with your values mapped to the names of placeholders in produced SQL query.

```python
{ 'names_p1_0': 'foo', 'names_p1_1': 'bar', 'names_p1_2': 'baz' }
```

## Bulk Inserts

Bulk operations (like inserts) requre a little different syntax, where each
inserted row is enclosed in parentheses. SQL Composer supports this with
by enclosing the row values in `AnotherGroup()` object. Here's the example:

```python
objects_to_insert = [
  {"name": "foo", "rss": "https://example.com/foo.xml"},
  {"name": "bar", "rss": "https://example.com/bar.xml"},
]

insert_feeds = loader.insert_feeds().and_return()
for obj in objects_to_insert:
  insert_feeds.values(binds=AnotherGroup(obj["name"], obj["rss"]))

cursor.execute(insert_feeds.sql(), insert_feeds.params)
```

This produces the following query:

```sql
INSERT INTO feeds(name, rss)
VALUES (:names_p1_0, :names_p1_1), (:names_p2_0, :names_p2_1)
RETURNING id, name, rss
```

## Simple Initialization

Some simple queries might not require any substitutions, but for clarity or
other reasons you might want to use SQL Composer for them anyway. Suppose we
have this script:

```sql
-- add_user.sql
INSERT INTO users(name, password)
VALUES :name, :username
```

You can use by passing necessary variables to the method which initializes
the script (`add_user()` here). It is much simpler and clearer than embedding
the query inside your code.

```python
add_user = loader.add_user(name="alice", password="hunter1")
cursor.execute(add_user.sql(), add_user.params)
```

Alternatively:

```python
add_user = loader.add_user()
add_user.update_params(name="alice", password="hunter1")
cursor.execute(add_user.sql(), add_user.params)
```

## Simplifying SQL

Normally `sql()` function doesn't touch the formatting of the output query.
If you pass `simplify=True` to it, it'll remove all lines which start with a
double dash (comments) and will put the whole query in a single line.

```python
add_user = loader.add_user(name="alice", password="hunter1")
print(add_user.sql())
```

This should output:

```
INSERT INTO users(name, password) VALUES :name, :username
```

Keep in mind that this won't remove any inline comments, so you might end up
with accidentally breaking half of your query if you use them.

## Query Copying

Sometimes you might want to execute some very similar queries but with
different values passed to them. This is especially useful when your database
engine has a limit on number of rows you can insert or on the size of the
query. Usually in these cases big queries are split into many smaller
queries.

If you'd use a single query, then in some cases, especially if you use
`Another()` and `AnotherGroup()` features, you could end up with duplicates
in your database from earlier queries.

Solution to this is to initialize common pieces of query once and then copy
it when needed. For example:

```python
insert_feeds = loader.insert_feeds().and_return()

for chunk in split_list(very_large_list_of_feeds):
  insert_copy = insert_feeds.copy()
  for obj in chunk:
    insert_copy.values(binds=AnotherGroup(obj["name"], obj["rss"]))
  cursor.execute(insert_copy.sql(), insert_copy.params)
```

## Dialects

Different databases and their drivers might use a different flavours of SQL.
For this reason SQL Composer allows specifying a dialect which it should use
for some parts of built query.

```python
loader = QueryLoader(package=queries, dialect="postgres")
```

Supported dialects are:

- sqlite (default)
    - named placeholders have form `:name`
- postgres
    - named placeholders have form `%(name)s`

# HEAL Data Utilities

The HEAL Data Utilities python package provides data packaging tools for the HEAL Data Ecosystem to facilitate data discovery, sharing, and harmonization on the [HEAL Platform](https://healdata.org).
 
Currently, the focus of this repository is generating standardized variable level metadata (VLMD) in the form of data dictionaries. ([Click here](vlmd/index.md) for the Variable-level Metadata documentation section).

However, in the future, this will be expanded for all HEAL-specific data packaging functions (e.g., study- and file-level metadata and data).

## Documentation

[__See here__](https://norc-heal.github.io/healdata-utils/) for documentation

## Prerequisites

### Python

While the HEAL Data Utilities should be compatible with most versions of Python, you can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it on your local computer. We recommend installing Python version 3.10 or higher.

## Installation

To install the latest official release of healdata-utils, from your computer's command prompt, run:

`pip install healdata-utils --pre` (**NOTE: currently in pre-lease**)

OR for the most up-to-date unreleased version run: 

`pip install git+https://github.com/norc-heal/healdata-utils.git`

!!! note

    Installing the unreleased version requires having `git` software
    installed.

## Variable-level Metadata (Data Dictionaries)

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/norc-heal/healdata-utils/HEAD?labpath=notebooks%2Fdemos%2Finputs-to-heal-data-dictionary.ipynb) 

The healdata-utils variable-level metadata (vlmd) tool inputs a variety of different input file types and exports HEAL-compliant data dictionaries (JSON and CSV formats). Additionally, exported validation (i.e., "error") reports provide the user information as to a) if the exported data dictionary is valid according to HEAL specifications and b) how to modify one's data dictionary to make it HEAL-compliant.

### Basic usage 

The vlmd tool can be used via python or the command line.

#### Using from python

From your current working directory in python, run:

```python
from healdata_utils.cli import convert_to_vlmd

# description and title are optional. If submitting through platform, can fill these out there.
description = "This is a proof of concept to demonstrate the healdata-utils functionality"
title = "Healdata-utils Demonstration Data Dictionary"
healdir = "output" # can also specify a file name if desired (eg output/thisismynewdd.csv)
inputpath = "input/my-redcap-data-dictionary-export.csv"

data_dictionaries = convert_to_vlmd(
    filepath=inputpath,
    outputdir=healdir, 
    inputtype=input_type, #if not specified, looks for suffix
    data_dictionary_props={"title":title,"description":description} #data_dictionary_props is optional
)
```

> This will output the data dictionaries to the specified output directory (see output section below) and also save the json/csv versions in the `data_dictionaries` object.

> For the available input file formats (i.e., the available choices for the `inputtype` parameter), one can run (from python):

```python
from healdata_utils.cli import input_descriptions

input_descriptions

```

The `input_descriptions` object contains the choice for `inputtype` as the key and the description as the value.

#### Using from the command line

From your current working directory run:
(note the `\` at the end of each line signals a line continuation for ease in understanding the long, one-line command.) Again, the `--title` and `--description` options are optional.
For descriptions on the different flags/options, run `vlmd --help`

```bash

vlmd --filepath "data/example_pyreadstat_output.sav" \
--outputdir "output-cli" \
--title "Healdata-utils Demonstration Data Dictionary" \
--description "This is a proof of concept to demonstrate the healdata-utils functionality" 
```

#### Output

Both the python and command line routes will result in a JSON and CSV version of the HEAL data dictionary in the output folder along with the validation reports in the `errors` folder. See below:

- `input/input/my-redcap-data-dictionary-export.csv` : your input file

- `output/errors/heal-csv-errors.json`: outputted validation report for table in csv file against frictionless schema
    - see schema [here](https://github.com/norc-heal/heal-metadata-schemas/blob/main/variable-level-metadata-schema/schemas/frictionless/csvtemplate/fields.json)
- `output/errors/heal-json-errors.json`:  outputted jsonschema validation report.
    - see schema [here](https://github.com/norc-heal/heal-metadata-schemas/blob/main/variable-level-metadata-schema/schemas/jsonschema/data-dictionary.json)

!!! important
    The main difference* between the CSV and JSON data dictionary validation lies in the way the data dictionaries are structured and the additional metadata included in the JSON data dictionary.
    
    The CSV data dictionary is a plain tabular representation with no additional metadata, while the JSON dataset includes fields along with additional metadata in the form of a root description and title.

    * for field-specific differences, see the schemas in the documentation. 
    

- `output/heal-csvtemplate-data-dictionary.csv`: This is the CSV data dictionary
- `output/heal-jsontemplate-data-dictionary.json`: This is the JSON version of the data dictionary

> Note, only the JSON version will have the user-specified `title` and `description`

README for WinDbg Copilot

WinDbg Copilot is a ChatGPT powered AI assistant integrated with WinDbg. It analyzes the output of the commands, and provides guidance to solve the stated problem.

# Prerequisites

        1. Operating System: Windows 10 and above.
        2. If you want to use OpenAI API, add environmet variable:
                OPENAI_API_KEY = <Openai API Key>
        3. If you want to use Azure OpenAI, add following environment variables:
                AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = <Azure OpenAI Endpoint>
                AZURE_OPENAI_KEY = <Azure OpenAI Key>
                AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = <Azure OpenAI Deployment Name>
        4. The Debugging Tools for Windows WinDbg (classic) installed on your machine, download url: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools
           For example: C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows (x64)
           Add environment variable WinDbg_PATH = C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows (x64).
           Add environment variable _NT_SYMBOL_PATH = srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
        5. Python version >=3.9, <3.12 installed on your machine.
        6. An Internet connection for downloading and installing the package.

## Installation:

1. First, you need to ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) if you haven't already.

2. Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell.

3. Install the package using `pip`:
    ```
    pip install WinDbg_Copilot
    ```

## Running the Console and GUI versions:

Users can run the console or GUI version as follows:

### Running the Console App:

Simply type in the Command Prompt or PowerShell:
```
windbg-copilot-console
```

### Running the GUI App:

Type in the Command Prompt or PowerShell:
```
windbg-copilot-gui
```

## Running using Python (as per your latest preference):

If users want to run the apps directly using Python:

### Running the Console App:

```
python -m WinDbg_Copilot.WinDbg_Copilot_Console
```

### Running the GUI App:

```
python -m WinDbg_Copilot.WinDbg_Copilot_GUI
```

Remember: The latter approach requires users to be in a directory containing the `WinDbg_Copilot` package directory, or to have the appropriate Python paths set up. If they installed the package via `pip`, the paths should be set up automatically.

## Choosing between Console and GUI:

custolint - custom linter
=========================

|Custolint Logo|

Your current code-validation pipeline rules may be changed more easily using **custolint**.

|Documentation| |Python Code Coverage| |License|

.. | docs | | coverage(100%) |

**Source Code**: `<https://github.com/a-da/custolint>`_.

Custolint add new layer on top of:

- `PyLint <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint>`_
- `Flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_
- `MyPy <https://github.com/python/mypy>`_
- `Python Coverage <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>`_


Motivation
----------

You cannot just add a linter and activate 100% inspections when you have a large,
ancient codebase with thousands of lines.

|Boromir Meme|

Instead, you only make 1% of the checks available, which is really frustrating for a decent developer.

*You could enable those 100% checks just for your changes with "custolint"*.

Idea
----

.. TODO: draw a diagram.

Given we have a project alike this one, where we:

1. had added a function ``custolint/generics.py:filer_output``.
2. had modified the function ``custolint/git.py:_blame``

.. code-block:: bash
    :name: given example

    $ tree
    ...
    |-- src
    |   |-- custolint
    ...
    |   |   |-- generics.py <<<< 1
    |   |   |-- git.py      <<<< 2
    |   |   |-- mypy.py
    |   |   |-- pylint.py
    |   |   `-- typing.py
    |-- tests
    |   `-- test_custolint.py
    ...

When:

- **Detect affected files** with ``git diff`` and ``git blame``

  - ``custolint/git.py``
  - ``custolint/generics.py``

- **Run the linter** tool (pylint, flake8, mypy, coverage ...) with all available feature enables
  (the configuration have to be placed into  ``config.d/`` folder)
  only on changed affected files or parse log/result of the linter tool.

- **Match changed code** with the linters output, and consider only the match lines as failed lint criteria.
  It has to detect that ``custolint/generics.py:filer_output`` need unitest for coverage
  and ``custolint/git.py:_blame`` introduce a mypy typing issue.

Then:

- **Fail or Report** the build.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coverage run --rcfile=config.d/.coveragerc -m pytest && \
        custolint coverage config.d/.coveragerc

Install
-------

See `Install dev version <docs/for_developers.rst>`_


How to run:
-----------

.. code-block::

    cd "${YOUR_CODE}/"

    # check typing
    custolint mypy

    # code smell checking with pylint
    custolint pylint

    # code smell checking with flake8
    custolint flake8

    # 100% coverage checking for new commits
    coverage run --rcfile=config.d/.coveragerc -m pytest
    custolint coverage config.d/.coverage

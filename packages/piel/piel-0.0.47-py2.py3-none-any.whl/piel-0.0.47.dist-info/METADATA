Microservices to codesign photonics, electronics, communications,
quantum, and more.

-   Free software: MIT license
-   Documentation: <https://piel.readthedocs.io>

## Target functionality

-   Co-simulation and optimisation between integrated photonic and
    electronic chip design.
-   System interconnection modelling in multiple domains.
-   Chip and interposer design integration.
-   Component models translation library between simulation tools.
-   Quantum models of physical circuitry.

`piel` aims to provide an integrated workflow to co-design photonics and
electronics, classically and quantum. It does not aim to replace the
individual functionality of each design tool, but rather provide a glue
to easily connect them all together and extract the system performance.

## Examples

Follow the many [examples in the
documentation](https://piel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

## Microservices Toolset

This package provides interconnection functions to easily co-design
microelectronics through the functionality of the
[IIC-OSIC-TOOLS](https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools) and
photonics via [GDSFactory](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory).

Some existing microservice dependency integrations are:

-   [cocotb](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb) - a coroutine based
    cosimulation library for writing VHDL and Verilog testbenches in
    Python.
-   [hdl21](https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Hdl21) - Analog Hardware
    Description Library in Python
-   [GDSFactory](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory) - An open
    source platform for end to-end photonic chip design and validation
-   [OpenLane v1](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane) - an
    automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including
    OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen and custom methodology scripts for
    design exploration and optimization
-   [sax](https://github.com/flaport/sax) - S-parameter based frequency
    domain circuit simulations and optimizations using JAX.
-   [thewalrus](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus) -A library for
    the calculation of hafnians, Hermite polynomials and Gaussian boson
    sampling.
-   [qutip](https://github.com/qutip/qutip) - QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in
    Python

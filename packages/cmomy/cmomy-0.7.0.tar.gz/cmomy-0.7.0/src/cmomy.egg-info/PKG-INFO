# cmomy

A Python package to calculate and manipulate Central (co)moments. The main
features of `cmomy` are as follows:

- [Numba][Numba] accelerated computation of central moments and co-moments
- Routines to combine, and resample central moments.
- Both [numpy][numpy] array-like and [xarray][xarray] DataArray interfaces to
  Data.
- Routines to convert between central and raw moments.

## Overview

`cmomy` is an open source package to calculate central moments and co-moments in
a numerical stable and direct way. Behind the scenes, `cmomy` makes use of
[Numba][Numba] to rapidly calculate moments. A good introduction to the type of
formulas used can be found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance).

## Features

- Fast calculation of central moments and central co-moments with weights
- Support for scalar or vector inputs
- numpy and xarray api's
- bootstrap resampling

## Status

This package is actively used by the author. Please feel free to create a pull
request for wanted features and suggestions!

## Quick start

Use one of the following

```bash
pip install cmomy
```

or

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cmomy
```

## Example usage

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import cmomy

>>> np.random.seed(0)
>>> x = np.random.rand(100)
>>> m = x.mean()
>>> mom = np.array([((x - m) ** i).mean() for i in range(4)])
>>> c = cmomy.CentralMoments.from_vals(x, mom=3)

>>> np.testing.assert_allclose(c.cmom(), mom, atol=1e-8)
>>> c.cmom()
array([1.    , 0.    , 0.0831, 0.0016])

# break up into chunks
>>> c = cmomy.CentralMoments.from_vals(x.reshape(-1, 2), mom=3)

>>> c
<CentralMoments(val_shape=(2,), mom=(3,))>
array([[5.0000e+01, 5.0013e-01, 7.9827e-02, 2.1156e-03],
       [5.0000e+01, 4.4546e-01, 8.4914e-02, 1.5954e-03]])

# Reduce along an axis
>>> c.reduce(axis=0).cmom()
array([1.    , 0.    , 0.0831, 0.0016])

# unequal chunks
>>> x0, x1, x2 = x[:20], x[20:60], x[60:]

>>> cs = [cmomy.CentralMoments.from_vals(_, mom=3) for _ in (x0, x1, x2)]

>>> c = cs[0] + cs[1] + cs[2]

>>> np.testing.assert_allclose(c.cmom(), mom, atol=1e-8)
>>> c.cmom()
array([1.    , 0.    , 0.0831, 0.0016])

```

## Note on caching

This code makes extensive use of the numba python package. This uses a jit
compiler to speed up vital code sections. This means that the first time a
function called, it has to compile the underlying code. However, caching has
been implemented. Therefore, the very first time you run a function, it may be
slow. But all subsequent uses (including other sessions) will be already
compiled.
